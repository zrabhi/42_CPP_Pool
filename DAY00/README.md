# 42_CPP_Pool

## Introduction

This is the first project we've ever done in C++. For this reason, things will start slow. In this first set of exercises we will learn about the basic syntax of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, and several other new concepts. All in all, it's lots of basic stuff.

### ex00. megaphone

This first exercise is quite simple, we are asked to create a program that takes arguments and prints them back to the terminal in capital letters. If no arguments are provided the program will print out a default message, also in captial letters.

### ex01. My Awesome PhoneBook

This second exercise is a bit more fun. We have to simulate a phonebook with a terminal interactive UI. We can ADD or SEARCH for contacts, and we can also EXIT, clearing the list of contacts and ending the program. The phonebook can receive up to 8 contacts, such that the 9th contact will replace the 1st contact, the 10th will replace the 2nd, and so on.
